# CodeTrain
My attempts at all of the coding train challenges done by Daniel Shiffman in his Coding Challenge series



``These will be done primarily in Processing (even if in the video he uses P5.js)``

Links to the specified videos will be in a readme in each folder, as well as a project description

Thanks to Daniel for being an awesome teacher.
